#The One Theme

A photo-centric theme, designed mobile first using HTML5 and CSS3. Compact and lightweight, but smooth and easy to use,
itâ€™s built with lots of attention to details to make the browsing experience a joy. Use The One to quickly set up a
photo blog and personalize it with your own logo and colors within minutes.

The One is a fork of [Valerie](https://github.com/thefrosty/valerie) which is no longer online (but still accessible via my forked copy) 
by Tung Do.

THe One is now build on [Hybrid Core](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core)
